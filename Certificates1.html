 <h3>Professional Certificates</h3>
 Coursera partners with leading companies to offer professional certificates that are tailored to industry needs. These certificates are designed to help individuals acquire job-ready skills and advance their careers. They are typically more focused on practical skills than academic knowledge.

Collaborations with Major Companies: Companies like Google, IBM, Meta (Facebook), and Microsoft work with Coursera to offer certificate programs that align with the skills employers are seeking. For example, the Google IT Support Professional Certificate prepares learners for entry-level IT roles, while IBM offers certificates in data science and artificial intelligence.
Beginner to Advanced Levels: Many of these certificates do not require prior experience in the field and are suitable for people entering a new career or those looking to upskill.
Career-Focused: The courses in these certificates often include real-world projects, technical skills, and case studies to ensure learners are job-ready by the end of the program.
Affordable and Accessible: Some certificates offer a flexible payment model or financial aid for learners in need, making them more accessible.
