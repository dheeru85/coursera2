 <h3>Specializations</h3>
 Specializations on Coursera are multi-course programs that allow learners to deeply engage with a specific subject area. These are particularly helpful for individuals looking to become experts in a particular field or gain a comprehensive understanding of a topic.

Focused Curriculum: A specialization is a sequence of related courses designed to build expertise step-by-step. For example, a specialization in Data Science might include courses on programming, data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
Capstone Projects: Many specializations conclude with a hands-on capstone project, where learners apply what theyâ€™ve learned to real-world scenarios.
Certification: Upon completion of a specialization, learners receive a certificate that they can share with potential employers or include in their resumes.
